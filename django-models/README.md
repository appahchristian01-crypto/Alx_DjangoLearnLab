# LibraryProject

This is my first Django project created for the **Introduction to Django Development Environment Setup** task.  

The goal of this project is to:
- Install Django and set up a development environment
- Create a new Django project named **LibraryProject**
- Run the development server and explore the default Django structure

### Project Structure
- **manage.py** — command-line tool for managing the project  
- **settings.py** — configuration file for the project  
- **urls.py** — defines URL routes for the site  
- **README.md** — explains the purpose of this project  

To view the default Django welcome page, run:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
